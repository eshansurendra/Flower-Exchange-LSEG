# Flower-Exchange-LSEG
This project implements a simplified Flower Exchange system as part of the C++ Workshop Series at the University of Moratuwa, organized by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). The Flower Exchange allows traders to buy and sell various types of flowers through a simulated trading platform.
